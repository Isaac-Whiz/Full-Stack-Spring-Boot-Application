## Introduction
Crafted with love, the Spring Boot Full Stack Appication is a secure Entrepise Resource Planning system the simplfies the task of managing human resources in an institution. 
Paywork, printing, reprinting, to collect and correct misforms on user collected information, the lookup for the users and eventually deleting them by the archeivers. However this application simplifies the creation, deletion, update and reading resources with the system. 

**Accessible through the web.**

## Features

A few of the things you can do with the application:

* View all saved persons.
* Update person's information.
* Create a new entry.
* Delete a person.
* And also authenticate or register with the system.
  

## Built With
### Frontend
- [React](https://www.w3schools.com/whatis/whatis_react.asp)
  
  This is a JavaScript library created by Facebook, a User Interface (UI) library and a tool for building UI components.
  This was used to create a number of components on the interface viz the buttons, drawers, and maniplating a couple of CSS properties listed but not limited to color, fonts, directions, sizes and many others.
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)
  
  Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced /vit/, like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of two major parts;
  A dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules, for example extremely fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR).
  A build command that bundles your code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production. This was used to provide ready servers for the frontend react development with 
  faster loading and automatic changes reflections.
### Backend
- [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)
  
  This is a general purpose, strongly typed, and object oriented programming languages used for creating stand alone and servelets. This was used to create the base (stack) of the application simply creating
  the models to provided the foundation for application construction.
- [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
  
  This is an extension of the Spring framework, Java annotation and dependency injection framework that provides a number of different applications in form of dependencies injectable into a basic Java 
  application for functionality enchancements and faster development with simple configurations.
  Some of its used applications in this project are described below;
    * [Spring Data JDBC](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jdbc)
      
      This simply stands for Java Database Connectivity, an application / dependency that provides connectivity and interaction with the database through writing [SQL](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/) 
      statements in Java code.
    * [Spring Data JPA](https://spring.io/projects/spring-data-jpa)
      
      This is stands for Java Persistance Api which is an application with in Spring Boot that enables and manages interaction with the database through writing english-like statements using [Hibernate](https://hibernate.org/) in the background for data persistance.
    * Spring Web
      
      This enables the creation of REST application as its the case with this application and uses Tomcat as the embedded web service for loading the Json / Xml at the given endpoint of the application.

## Feedback

Feel free to send us feedback on [Twitter / X](https://x.com/IsaacWavamuno?s=09), [Mail](ssekajjawavamuno@gmail.com) else [file an issue](https://github.com/Isaac-Whiz/Full-Stack-Spring-Boot-Application/issues).

## Build Process

- Follow the [React Native Guide](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/getting-started.html) for getting started building a project with native code. **A Mac is required if you wish to develop for iOS.**
- Clone or download the repo
- `yarn` to install dependencies
- `yarn run link` to link react-native dependencies
- `yarn start:ios` to start the packager and run the app in the iOS simulator (`yarn start:ios:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](<https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger>))
- `yarn start:android` to start the packager and run the app in the the Android device/emulator (`yarn start:android:logger` will boot the application with [redux-logger](https://github.com/evgenyrodionov/redux-logger))

Please take a look at the [contributing guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for a detailed process on how to build your application as well as troubleshooting information.

**Development Keys**: The `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` in `api/index.js` are for development purposes and do not represent the actual application keys. Feel free to use them or use a new set of keys by creating an [OAuth application](https://github.com/settings/applications/new) of your own. Set the "Authorization callback URL" to `gitpoint://welcome`.
